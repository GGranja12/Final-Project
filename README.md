## *Project Overview* üìù

#### Welcome to my Airbnb Lisbon's Listings Exploratory Data Analysis!

This mid-project was developed during Ironhack's Data Analytics course, aiming to showcase and solidify the knowledge acquired over the past months. The project focuses on applying visualization and Python skills, exploratory data analysis techniques, and the development of machine learning models. 

## *The Dataset* üóÉ

The data was retrieved from 2 different csv. files (lisbon_weekdays.csv and lisbon_weekends.csv) which can be downloaded by accessing this [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-price-determinants-in-europe?select=lisbon_weekdays.csv) The Airbnb listings were originally webscrapped by Krist√≥f Gy√≥di and ≈Åukasz Nawaro to develop their paper ["_Determinants of Airbnb prices in European cities: A spatial econometrics approach_"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517721000388?via%3Dihub).

The provided csv. files comprise 2019 data of Airbnb listings available in Lisbon, either respective to weekday bookings (Tuesday-Thursday; lisbon_weekdays.csv) or to weekend bookings (Friday-Sunday; lisbon_weekdends.csv). Both files present one listing price column and 18 attributes as follows:

- **realSum**: the full price of accommodation for two people and two nights in EUR
- **room_type**: the type of the accommodation
- **room_shared**: dummy variable for shared rooms 
- **room_private**: dummy variable for private rooms
- **person_capacity**: maximum number of guests
- **host_is_superhost**: dummy variable for superhost status
- **multi**: dummy for listings offered by hosts with 2‚Äì4 listings
- **biz**: dummy for listings offered by hosts with more than 4 listings
- **cleanliness_rating**: cleanliness rating
- **guest_satisfaction_overall**: overall rating of the listing (scale to 100)
- **bedrooms**: number of bedrooms (0 for studios)
- **dist**: distance to the city centre in km
- **metro_dist**: distance from nearest metro station in km
- **attr_index**: attraction index of the listing location
- **attr_index_norm**: normalised attraction index (0-100)
- **rest_index**: restaurant index of the listing location
- **rest_index_norm**: normalised restaurant index (0-100)
- **lng**: longitude of the listing location
- **lat**: latitude of the listing location

## *Project Development* üõ†Ô∏è

This [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/DUtscQkn/ironhack-midproject) provides access to the project's workflow, detailing all tasks developed over the three-week period.

#### *Tableau dashboards* üìä

After applying data preparation and cleaning techniques in a Python notebook, I developed [Tableau dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/guilherme.granja/viz/Airbnb_LisbonDashboard/Painel2?publish=yes) to provide the audience with a clear and straighforward overview of insightful aspects related to our Airbnb Lisbon's accommodation attributes and price. 

#### *Exploratory Data Analysis* 

The EDA process included the following key tasks:

- Correlation Analysis: An overview of relationships between continuous variables, supported by heatmap and scatterplot visualizations;
- Categorical Variable Insights: Chi-square tests and interpretation of Cram√©r's V results to evaluate relationships between categorical variables;
- Hypothesis Testing: Assessing assumptions and drawing conclusions about the data;
- Distribution and Outlier Analysis: Examining variable distributions and identifying potential outliers.

#### *Supervised Machine Learning - Regression Models* ü¶æ üìà

Keeping in mind that our target feature is listing price, the machine learning process consisted in first applying 4 different supervised models (Linear, Decision Tree, XGboost and Random Forest) and finally fine-tuning the Random Forest model using the GridSearch hyperparameter tuning.

As a final step, we calculated and compiled four different metrics (R2, RMSE, MSE and MAE) for each one of the 5 models, to facilitate the comparison of their fitness and predictive capacity, and retrieved Random Forest model feature importances.
